This is the "Files" example app. 

It was created for Mac OS X, and targeted to version 10.7, in June 2012. 

Files is a very simple app. It will get a list of files and folders in the current user's home directory, and display them in the debug console log window in Xcode. 

All the executable code is in main.m, which is located in the "Files" group.
